# SalesDatabase
This repository deals with business scenarios related to the database available at http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx

The repository (master branch) consists of two major components/sub-branches. 
1) Component-1/Problem-1 : A java program is built to predict which invoices have been paid and which invoices have not been paid while working on the
Sales Database of the classicmodels ( a retailer of scale models of classic cars). To meet this business scenario, the database schema has been modified.

2) Component-2/Problem-2: It has the SQL file : Queries_Problem2.sql has queries where the sales database is queried to answer 5 business questions. 
Please refer the Assignment-5 pdf document for the 5 questions. For this particular problem, the original database (not the one modified above) is used.
